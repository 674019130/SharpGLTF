

Before running the tests in Visual Studio, or by Command line, first we need to download the required test files.

To do so, we just need to run "1_DownloadTestFiles.cmd" once.  If we need to update the test files we can run it again.

After the test files have been successfully downloaded, we can either run the tests in Visual Studio, or run "2_RunTests.cmd"
