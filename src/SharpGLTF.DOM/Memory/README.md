### Byte Array Accessors
 
 Most data within glTF is stored in binary buffers. These buffers store both integer and floating point values.
 
 In order to save space, buffer data can be encoded in different ways.
 
 The helper classes in this namespace simplify the process of reading and writing encoded data to buffers.
